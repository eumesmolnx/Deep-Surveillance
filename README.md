# Deep-Surveillance
Deep learning model for video surveillance.

It will analyze the video feeds in real-time to identify abnormal events like violence, security breaches, theft, etc. We train an autoencoder for abnormal event detection. Now, we identify the abnormal events based on the euclidean distance of the custom video feed and the frames predicted by the autoencoder.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
